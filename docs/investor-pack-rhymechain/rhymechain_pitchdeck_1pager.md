# RHYMECHAIN PITCH DECK (1-PAGER)
**The Sorare of Hip-Hop Culture**

---

## 1. THE HOOK
"Fans spend $30B on music streaming but earn $0. Artists earn $0.003 per stream. RhymeChain turns music into a competitive sport where everyone wins."

## 2. THE PROBLEM
1. **Broken Artist Economics:** Streaming does not pay for 99% of talent.
2. **Passive Consumption:** Gen Z wants to participate, not just listen.
3. **Missing Link:** No platform bridges real-world music success with game-play.

## 3. THE SOLUTION
A Fantasy League where you:
- **Build your Label** by collecting NFT Artist Cards.
- **Compete** in tournaments driven by real Spotify/Apple data.
- **Earn** $RHYCON and rare assets based on your scouting skill.

## 4. TRACTION & PROOF
- MVP Core Loop functional on zkEVM.
- Exclusive pipeline of 50+ emerging hip-hop artists.
- 10k+ pre-launch waitlist.

## 5. REVENUE MODEL
- **Drops:** High-frequency card pack sales (20% platform take).
- **Exchange:** 5% fee on second-hand trades.
- **Premium:** Subscription for advanced "Scouting Tools".

## 6. THE TEAM
