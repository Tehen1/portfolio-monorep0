# RHYMECHAIN LITE PAPER
**Fantasy Hip-Hop League powered by Web3**

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
RhymeChain revolutionizes fan engagement by gamifying music discovery. Players act as "Record Label Executives," scouting real-world artists, collecting their NFT cards, and competing in weekly tournaments based on real streaming data.

## 2. MARKET PROBLEM
- **Artists:** 99% of artists cannot live off streaming royalties ($0.003/stream). They need high-margin products.
- **Fans:** Passive consumption is boring. Gen Z wants participation and ownership.
- **Industry:** No platform successfully gamifies music data like sports data.

## 3. THE SOLUTION: PLAY-AND-EARN
**The Loop:**
1. **Scout:** Find underratted artists on Spotify.
2. **Collect:** Buy their Genesis NFT Card on RhymeChain.
3. **Compete:** Enter your cards in weekly "Charts" tournaments.
4. **Win:** If your artists perform well IRL (streams/views), you win $RHYCON tokens and rare cards.

## 4. TOKENOMICS ($RHYCON)
- **Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 (Fixed).
- **Utility:**
  - Tournament Entry Fees
  - Marketplace Currency
  - Governance (DAO) voting on Artist signing
  - Staking for "Label Status"
- **Deflationary:** 20% of marketplace fees are burned or sent to Treasury.

## 5. BUSINESS MODEL
1. **Primary Sales (Drops):** We sell card packs. (Split: 80% Artist / 20% RhymeChain).
2. **Secondary Market:** 5% fee on all P2P trades.
3. **Sponsorships:** Brand tournaments (e.g., "The Red Bull Rookie Cup").

## 6. ROADMAP
- **Q3 2025:** Team Assembly & Smart Contract Audit.
- **Q4 2025:** Private Beta + First 10 Artist Signings.
- **Q1 2026:** Public Launch (Season 1) + Token TGE.
